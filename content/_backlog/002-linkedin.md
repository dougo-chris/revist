Hate pitching yourself on LinkedIn?

Use the “10:3:1” LinkedIn outreach system a method that builds warm connections, without feeling awkward or salesy.

Last week, I spoke to six tech professionals. All job hunting. None with a system.

Step 1: Search strategically

• Use the search bar. Type roles you want next: “Engineering Manager”, “Product Designer”, “Tech Lead”
• Click “People”
• Filter by location (e.g. Sydney, Melbourne)
• Filter by industry (e.g. Information Technology, Startups)
• Add “Current Company” filter if you’ve got a shortlist

Step 2: Choose 10 profiles daily (or weekly)

Scan for:
• Shared backgrounds (bootcamps, unis, career switches)
• Work at companies you admire
• Mutuals in common

Save these to a doc or spreadsheet.

Step 3: Personalise the connection note
Don’t skip this, people remember those who take the time.

📍 Template: Referencing a post

“Hey [Name], just read your post on [topic]super relevant as I’m exploring [similar role or space]. Would love to connect.”

📍 Template: Mutual context

“Hey [Name], noticed we both worked in [X] or follow [Y]. Always keen to connect with folks solving interesting problems.”

📍 Template: Direct but friendly

“Hey [Name], saw your profile while exploring [industry/role]. I’m currently in transition and learning from others doing solid work. Thought I’d say hi.”

Step 4: Engage with 3 of their posts

• Leave thoughtful comments (not just likes)
• Highlight a takeaway or ask a follow-up
• If they haven’t posted, check what they engage with

Step 5: Nurture 1 relationship per week

• Follow up with a question about their role, team, or journey
• Offer something of value (a resource, intro, or perspective)
• Ask if they’d be open to a quick virtual coffee

Why this works:
→ You build visibility without spamming
→ You stand out with relevance
→ You learn directly from people doing the work

Start small. 5 reach-outs per week is plenty.

No automation. No sales pitch. Just real conversations.

In tech, trust opens doors faster than resumes.
