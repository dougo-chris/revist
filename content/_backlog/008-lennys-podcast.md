Yes, Chip made some specific and insightful comments about "positive energy" as a key to thriving as an older worker in tech. Here's what he said:

## The Core Advice

When discussing what older workers need to do to succeed, Chip said:

> "Show up with curiosity and a passionate engagement for what you do, and people won't necessarily notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy."

## Two Components of Energy

Chip broke down "energy" into two distinct parts:

**1. Physical Energy**:
- Not just resting on your laurels
- Having physical vitality in how you do your job
- Being "age fluid" - not defined by your age
- Showing you can work intensely (he mentioned working 60-70 hours a week and traveling globally as Airbnb's "secretary of state")

**2. Positive Energy** (the "California energetic" type):
- Having an upbeat, optimistic presence
- Being someone others are drawn to
- Creating a positive feeling in meetings and interactions

## The Impact at Airbnb

Chip reflected on how this played out practically:

> "I think one of the things that I would say I did well at Airbnb... I was very approachable. And over the course of time, the number of mentees I had, the number of people who just wanted to have coffee with me or tea, the number of people who just said, thank you for being in that meeting, You just sort of gave it a positive feeling... was really important."

## The Result

This approach meant that despite being significantly older than his colleagues:

> "No one was looking at me and saying, let's get rid of the old fogey. Well, maybe some people were, but I wasn't aware of them."

The key insight is that **energy and positivity can make age irrelevant** - people respond to your vitality and optimism rather than focusing on demographic differences. It's about showing up as someone who energizes rooms rather than drains them.
