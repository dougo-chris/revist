# The upside of ageing

Yes, Chip is passionate about reframing aging from something to fear into something with genuine upsides. This is central to his work and based on both research and personal experience.

## The Cultural Problem

Chip identified that society has a deeply negative view of aging:

> "There's a belief that life gets worse as you get older. And, um, and if you can survive your midlife crisis, all you have to look forward to is disease decrepitude and death."

He contrasts this with his book "Learning to Love Midlife" which has the subtitle: **"twelve reasons why life gets better with age."**

## The Research: U-Curve of Happiness

Chip cited global research showing the "U-curve of happiness":

- **Ages 18-24**: Generally happy
- **Ages 24-50**: Slow decline in life satisfaction, bottoming out around 45-50
- **Ages 50+**: Steady increase in happiness
- **The pattern**: People are happier in their 50s than 40s, 60s than 50s, 70s than 60s, etc.

> "I'm happier today at sixty four than I was at forty seven when I was going through my flatline experience."

## Specific Upsides of Aging

Chip mentioned several concrete benefits:

**1. Emotional Intelligence Growth**
- This naturally develops with age and experience

**2. Enhanced Wisdom** 
- Though not automatic - requires processing life experience mindfully

**3. Learning to Edit**
- > "You can't you you have no more f's left to give. No more fucks left to give. There that is absolutely true, especially for women as they age."

**4. Spiritual Curiosity**
- Greater interest in meaning and purpose

**5. Becoming Whole vs. Compartmentalized**
- > "When you're younger, you're compartmentalized. As you go grow older, you are growing whole."
- Integration of different aspects of personality (introvert/extrovert, masculine/feminine, etc.)

**6. Presence and Authenticity**
- > "The people who I really admire who are eighty five years old, they're so present and they're so whole. They're like, they are just who they are."

## The Health Impact

Most remarkably, Chip cited Becca Levy's Yale research:

> "When you shift your mindset on aging from a negative to a positive, you get seven and a half years of additional life, which is more life than any other biohack that's being done right now."

## Pro-Aging vs. Anti-Aging

Chip advocates for a **"pro-aging"** rather than just **"anti-aging"** mindset:

> "When you actually have a pro aging point of view and you see the upside of aging, you take better care of yourself. Both your mind and your body. You actually are willing to learn and try new things."

## Personal Example

He illustrated this with his own experience moving to Baja at 56:

> "I had a mindset which was I'm too old to learn Spanish. I'm too old to learn to surf. But when I said ten years from now, what will I regret if I don't learn it or do it now? And I said, well, ten years from now, I might still be living in Baja... And so I did."

## The Midlife Chrysalis

Instead of "midlife crisis," Chip promotes "midlife chrysalis":

> "If you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis... At the time, you know, when you're going through it, it's like, oh, shit. My life my life is liquefying in front of myself. But, you know, on the other side of it, there's a metamorphosis that happens."

The core message is that **aging and living are the same thing** - and there are genuine, research-backed reasons to look forward to getting older rather than just dreading it.
