# What thorny problem are you facing and how can I fix it for you.

Yes, this was part of Chip's advice for older workers trying to get their foot in the door at companies, especially in tech. Here's the context:

## The Challenge for Older Workers

Chip acknowledged that not everyone gets recruited like he was:

> "I'm privileged. So for those of you who are listening or watching this, and you're saying, well, you know, Chip, you were fifty two years old and they came to you. Like, that doesn't happen to me. I'm not in that position."

## The Strategic Approach

Instead of the traditional resume approach, Chip suggested leading with **problem-solving value**:

> "I think it was... someone asked it. I don't remember if it's Sheryl Sandberg or someone else asked her. He said, like, what's the biggest problem you're dealing with here? And how can I help you? Like that's a great that's a great line."

## Why This Works

This approach is powerful because:

**1. It's Customer-Focused**
- You're immediately thinking about their needs, not your needs for a job

**2. It Demonstrates Value First**
- Rather than asking "What can you do for me?" you're asking "What can I do for you?"

**3. It Leverages Experience**
- Older workers often have diverse experience solving complex problems across different contexts

**4. It Gets Past Ageism**
- Instead of focusing on age/credentials, you're focusing on solving actual business pain points

## The Resume Revolution

Chip also suggested completely rethinking resumes for older workers:

> "What I love to see is not so much what roles you've had, what bullet points do you have of yours like things you've learned... Give me in a paragraph... a thorny problem you faced. Um, what what was the problem and how you got how you what skills you used to actually accomplish it, and what was the result of that."

## The Advantage of Age

He noted this approach particularly benefits older workers:

> "I would love to see a resume like that. And the older you are, the more you can actually have a resume like that. And then you can use that as the conversation piece when you're doing inter your interviews."

## Practical Application

Instead of:
- "I was VP of Marketing at Company X for 5 years"
- Generic bullet points about responsibilities

Try:
- "Company X was losing market share to a disruptive competitor. I identified that our messaging was too technical for decision-makers. I developed a new positioning strategy that resulted in 30% increase in qualified leads within 6 months."

The key is **leading with the problem** you solved, not the title you held. This immediately demonstrates your value and gives interviewers a concrete example of how you think and operate.

This approach transforms the conversation from "Are you too old?" to "Can you solve problems like this for us?"
