# "culture fit" and "culture add"

Chip made an important distinction between "culture fit" and "culture add" that reflects more inclusive hiring practices:

## Culture Fit (The Problem)

Chip explained that traditional "culture fit" can be problematic:

> "There's language about culture fit. I like to say culture ad. Because culture fit to me means, uh, can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration. Um, you have to fit in. And especially if this is like a demographic thing, a person of color, a gay person, a, you know, a person in a wheelchair. So you have to fit in."

The issue with "culture fit" is that it:
- Implies conformity to existing norms
- Can exclude people who are different demographically
- Puts the burden on diverse candidates to "fit in" rather than bringing their authentic selves
- Can perpetuate homogeneous teams

## Culture Add (The Better Approach)

Instead, Chip advocates for "culture add":

> "But a culture ad suggests that actually having some diversity on the team is helpful because it actually adds to the culture. But it's still you still have to be able to get along in that culture."

Culture add means:
- Recognizing that diversity **enhances** the culture
- Valuing what different perspectives bring to the team
- Understanding that some level of difference is beneficial, not threatening
- Still requiring basic compatibility with core values and working style

## The Balance

Chip acknowledges you still need some baseline compatibility:

> "But it's still you still have to be able to get along in that culture."

So it's not about hiring people who clash with fundamental company values, but rather seeking people who can work within the culture while bringing fresh perspectives, experiences, and ways of thinking that make the culture richer and more effective.

This distinction is particularly relevant for age diversity in tech, where older workers might not "fit" the typical young, fast-paced startup culture, but can "add" wisdom, emotional intelligence, and different problem-solving approaches that benefit the entire team.
