1. “GIVE AWAY THE FARM”

-Anthony creates content that is so valuable in each post to his specific audience (B2B SaaS companies), that people would “pay for it”.
- This mentality he calls “Giving Away the Farm” and helps build trust and position himself as an authority

2. “SHOW EXPERTIES, SELL IMPLIMENTATION”

- In each of his posts, Anthony gives away his frameworks, tips and real-world examples, but his core philosophy is: “Give the core expertise freely, and sell the hands-on implementation.”
- Prospects are free to try the implementation themselves, but may prefer to hire him for faster, more efficient results
- The benefit of this is when prospects reach out, they already know how Anthony works. There is no need to break down his process and they are aligned to work together.

3. HYPER FOCUS

- What he does is clear.
- “I help founders market hard to market products”
- CTA: “Let’s rewrite your home page”
- Targets very specific segment of founders
- There is no guessing what he does.

4. CLEAR FUNNEL

- simple & straightforward funnel for how to get clients:

a) Publish hyper targeted LI post
b) Clear CTA
c) Direct prospects to website w/ video explainer
d) Transparent pricing
e) Calendly link to book Discovery Call

5. PRE-QUALIFY PROSPECTS

- Anthony’s leads are already pre-sold on his philosophy because they have consumed his content for months before reaching out

6. CONSISTENCY, ENGAGMENT & AUTHENTICITY

- Actively engages with audience, commenting, asking questions and iterating based on the feedback he receives by putting himself and his company out there with his posts
- Anthony is not a fence sitter and puts his perspective out there, though it may be “spikey”. This helps attract like minded people who are bought into his process

TAKEAWAY

I’m a big fan of Anthony’s work and have been following him for some time now.

Generosity builds trust.

Clear positioning makes it easy for prospects to get on board with what you do

or filter out those who are not aligned.

Consistent engagement and iterating on what works helps maintain relevancy.

“No HARD”, selling is what scales.

On calls Anthony only works with people who trust his expertise.

This comes from the brand he's built.
