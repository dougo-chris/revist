If I have a problem or a decision to make, i’ll upload entire books into ChatGPT and have the author coach me.

For example:

-Trying to improve my health? I uploaded Outlive and asked what Peter Attia would change about my habits
-Writing copy? I fed it Scientific Advertising and had Claude Hopkins critique my landing page and emails
-For strategy, I uploaded a Buffett bio and a McKinsey book and asked how they’d solve it.

This is how i do it:

1. Buy the ebook (epub or PDF is best) / sometimes can find ebooks for free on Google books. Can even download the free samples for the jist
2. Convert it to a .txt file using Convertio
3. Upload it to ChatGPT
4. Ask questions like the author is your advisor

This has helped me 10x my strategy and decision making


A great one from Andrew Wilkinson (he might have shared it on your pod): the meeting brief generator.

1. 30 minutes before each meeting, his AI assistant activates
2. Searches the attendee's background using Perplexity for context
3. Pulls their LinkedIn profile to understand their work history
4. Analyzes past emails to extract key discussion points
5. Delivers a complete briefing via text message to his phone
