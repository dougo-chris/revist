1. Opportunity often looks like a curveball

Running a podcast as a side project is A LOT. Who knew? For Phoebe, Cheeky Run Club is her outlet, her co-founder moment. 

"It feels like an extension of us [Phoebe and Anna]."
"Even non-runners are showing up for women's health content."

Side projects can be powerful if:

They're built from a place of joy. Create something you wish existed for you. Provide public accountability. Document what you’re already doing.

For Phoebs, that's a community of amateur runners. For me, that's a community of operators learning in public and knowing they’re not alone.

2. How are you contributing to the situation you say you don’t want?

This is about shifting from a victim to player mindset. Due to trauma, I can easily slip into victim mode. Therapy helps me catch it. It gets worked on. 

This question is a real-time reframe: 
How am I contributing to this outcome? What can I control? That shift moves me (and you) from blaming circumstances to exercising agency.

3. Company building

AI is lowering the barriers to starting companies. I loved Phoebe's framing around how this opens doors for more female-led startups. I agree. It's helping more people turn ideas into reality.

A reminder: Pay attention to who’s hacking away at hackathons. Start clubs. Build peer-learning communities. Surround yourself with more female builders.

4. Lead in a way that feels authentic

Reflect on the moments when you’re at your best. How can you bring that energy to your leadership?

Double down on your best traits. Stay aware of your blind spots. And work on them (insert help from a coach, mentor, therapist, friend). Partner with people who complement your gaps and see the world differently.

5. Translate vision into operational reality

Phoebe’s framework has three interconnected layers:

Layer 1: Structured goal hierarchy

- North star metric: A number representing 10-year success
- Long-term goals: 5-year ambitious best-case growth
- Medium-term goals: 12-month and 6-month operational targets
- Daily priorities: Individual work that ladders up to bigger objectives

"Your North Star will be wrong. The five-year goals will be wrong. That's fine. It's just a structure to keep you moving in the right direction."

Layer 2: Values as operational tools

Company values aren't wall art—they're decision-making frameworks. Embed them in daily choices.

Layer 3: Process and ritual design

Decide how you’ll communicate progress. Use tools that create alignment. Reinforce priorities through rhythms and rituals that echo them across the org.
