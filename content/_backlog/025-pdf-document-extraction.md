LlamaParse

I have extensive experience in this area, and I find LlamaParse to be the best. It’s the most accurate anyway

You can’t use a Python library for any serious application where accuracy is important 90% of the Python libraries out there just extract text based on decoding the pdf binary. This is highly innacurate and won’t understand tables and other complex structures well

You need an OCR based approach ideally utilising computer vision to get any real results

Extraction is one of, if not the most important part of the RAG process

We have used AWS Textract, Azure document Intelligence, Unstructured and every Python library under the sun

And LlamaParse is the clear winner

Under the hoods it’s just usual multi modal vision models to parse images generated from the document

You can use their fast tier which is not as accurate, or you can use their computer vision model for like 15x the price

I’m also super impressed with their customer service , can’t recommend enough

Edit: just to clarify - I am not saying the only way to do this via SaaS, I am saying if you value your time and prefer to work on the useful problems , the best way is SaaS
