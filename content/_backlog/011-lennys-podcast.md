# Hierarchy of Needs

Yes, Chip discussed two key pyramids from his "Peak" book, both based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These became organizing frameworks he used extensively, including at Airbnb:

## The Employee Pyramid

This hierarchy shows what motivates employees, from bottom to top:

**Base: Money/Compensation**
- The foundational need
- Can be 90% of the pyramid in some industries/roles
- Just because it's at the base doesn't mean it's not the dominant part

**Middle: Recognition** 
- Acknowledgment of contributions
- Feeling valued and seen

**Top: Meaning**
- Sense of purpose in the work
- Connection to something larger

### Industry Variations
Chip noted how this varies by sector:
- **High-paying industries**: Money might be 90% of the pyramid
- **Nonprofits**: Money layer is thin, meaning is huge
- **The differentiator**: Often recognition and meaning, not just compensation

## The Customer Pyramid

This shows how to create exceptional customer experiences:

**Base: Meeting Expectations**
- Delivering what customers expect
- Basic service/product quality

**Middle: Meeting Desires**
- Going beyond expectations
- Fulfilling wants customers can articulate

**Top: Meeting Unrecognized Needs**
- Addressing needs customers didn't even know they had
- The most powerful differentiator

### Airbnb Example

Chip described how this pyramid led to a major strategic shift at Airbnb:

> "About a year after I joined and when Jonathan Mildenhall was joining is we really tried to ask ourselves, are we in the home sharing business, or are we in some kind of business that is even bigger and broader than that? And ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business. Airbnb was not in home sharing. We were in belonging anywhere."

This realization that the **unrecognized need** was "belonging anywhere" (not just accommodation) became:
- An organizing principle for host training
- The foundation for marketing/advertising strategy  
- A competitive advantage ("hotels are not everywhere, but homes are")

## The Power of Hierarchies

Chip emphasized that these pyramid models are valuable because they:
- Provide organizing principles for decision-making
- Help identify what really differentiates you
- Guide strategy across different functions
- Make abstract concepts tangible and actionable

He noted that 18 years after publishing "Peak," he still gives 20-30 speeches per year on these concepts, showing their enduring relevance for leaders trying to understand human motivation and customer value.
