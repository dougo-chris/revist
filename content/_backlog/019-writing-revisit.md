# Single Action Done Well

- The goal is to complete one task
  - without moving into something else
  - without changing the expectations

Software Development comes easy. I can do it for hours. Exploring new ways to solve problems.
  - Problems are something I haven't solved yet
  - I call it gut feel on knowing the approach to explore more about. Is that really true. What If it's wrong and I'm just better at stopping earlier than others. Gut feel told me to start this in the first place. I've already packed my bags and started the wrong journey. It's more than just gut feel. It's identifying when the effort is becoming too great and a previous choice may have been better.

Writing has been hard.
  - I find myself exploring the internet for more ideas.
  - I ask myself "Would AI do this better"
  - Has someone already written about this. What's new about how I did it?

The goal is not about promoting new ideas and methods.
  - Share what I do
  - Articulate my approach
  - Give another perspective on why we do things this way
  - Open up a discussion about what I enjoy and do every day.

- Turn off the music!
I've been writing software for 30 years. It's now second nature on how to do things. It's also something you do by yourself.
Listening to music is something that get's me into the rhythm of writing code. If someone asked what I was listening to I'd probably not be able to tell them. It's just noise and a rhythm of work I've come to enjoy. But a lot of that is because I now see myself as an expert software developer.

For writing, I'm definitely no expert. I need **no** distractions. I need a quiet space. I need no food or drink. I just need a laptop and time to write. Turn off the music and discover my creativity.

### Ask better questions
_Note : They are not always great questions_

- Answer the question
  - Why this answer?
  - Do I have an example I've experienced?
  - Do I have an example I've heard from others?
